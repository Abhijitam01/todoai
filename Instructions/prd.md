## 4. Feature Specifications

This section details the core features required for the initial release (MVP) and subsequent iterations.

### 4.1 Goal Input Interface

*   **Description:** The primary entry point for users to define their goal for the AI to process.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a first-time user, I want to easily tell the app my goal, target date, and how much time I can commit so it can create a plan for me.
    *   As a user adding a new goal, I want the input process to be quick and intuitive.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The interface must have clear input fields for:
        *   Goal Name (text input, e.g., "Learn Python", "Run a Half Marathon")
        *   Timeframe (input with options like "X Days", "X Weeks", "X Months", "By Date YYYY-MM-DD")
        *   *Optional:* Time per Day/Week (input with numerical value and units like "minutes", "hours", "per day", "per week") - Default to 1 hour/day if not specified.
        *   *Optional:* Starting Skill Level (dropdown/selection, e.g., "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced") - Default to "Beginner".
    *   Input fields must have clear labels and placeholder text (e.g., "Enter your goal here", "e.g., 90 Days or 3 Months", "e.g., 1 hour per day").
    *   Basic input validation must be performed (e.g., timeframe is a valid number/date format, time per day is positive).
    *   A "Create Plan" button must be prominent and trigger the AI processing flow.
    *   The interface should provide examples of valid goals/timeframes.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User enters a timeframe of 0 days or an excessively long timeframe (e.g., 100 years).
    *   User enters text for timeframe numerical value.
    *   User leaves the Goal Name blank.
    *   User enters a vague goal that the AI might struggle to interpret.
    *   Network error occurs when submitting the goal.

### 4.2 AI Goal Decomposer (Leveraging GPT or similar)

*   **Description:** The core AI engine that translates the user's high-level goal parameters into a structured, time-bound plan of milestones, weekly goals, and daily tasks.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want the app to automatically break down my complex goal into smaller, manageable steps using AI.
    *   As a user, I want the generated plan to fit within my specified timeframe and daily time commitment.
    *   As a user, I want the plan to be logically structured with clear milestones.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system must send a well-structured prompt to the AI model incorporating the Goal Name, Timeframe, Time per Day (if specified), and Skill Level (if specified).
    *   The AI model must return a response in the specified JSON format:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "week": 1,
            "milestone": "Learn Python Basics",
            "days": [
              {"day": 1, "task": "Install Python, Set up IDE", "expected_time_minutes": 60},
              {"day": 2, "task": "Understand variables and data types", "expected_time_minutes": 60},
              ...
            ]
          },
          ...
          {
            "week": N,
            "milestone": "Complete Final Project",
            "days": [
              {"day": X, "task": "Build feature A", "expected_time_minutes": 60},
              ...
              {"day": Y, "task": "Deploy project", "expected_time_minutes": 60}
            ]
          }
        ]
        ```
        *(Self-correction: Add `expected_time_minutes` to tasks for better adaptation logic)*
    *   The generated plan must cover the entire specified timeframe (e.g., 90 days -> 90 daily tasks or breaks).
    *   Daily tasks should be atomic and generally achievable within the specified "Time per Day."
    *   The JSON response must be parsable by the backend system.
    *   The system should display a summary or preview of the generated plan to the user before saving it.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   AI service is unavailable or returns an error.
    *   AI returns poorly formatted or invalid JSON.
    *   AI generates irrelevant, nonsensical, or dangerous tasks.
    *   AI plan is significantly shorter or longer than the requested timeframe.
    *   AI tasks are vastly over or under the specified "Time per Day."
    *   The prompt hits AI token limits.
    *   AI struggles with highly niche or abstract goals.

### 4.3 Daily Todo Dashboard

*   **Description:** The primary view users see upon opening the app, showing their tasks for the current day and allowing interaction.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to see exactly what tasks I need to do today for my active goal(s).
    *   As a user, I want to easily mark tasks as completed.
    *   As a user, I want to be able to defer a task to a later time or day if I can't do it now.
    *   As a user, I want to see if I have overdue tasks from previous days.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The dashboard must display tasks assigned to the current date for the user's active goal (or a combined view if managing multiple goals - *start with single active goal view for MVP*).
    *   Each task item must display the task description.
    *   Each task item must have controls to mark it as "Complete."
    *   Marking a task "Complete" should visually update its status (e.g., strikethrough, checkbox checked, move to a "Completed Today" section).
    *   Tasks assigned to previous dates that were not completed must be clearly labeled as "Overdue" on the current day's dashboard.
    *   There must be an option to "Snooze" or "Reschedule" a task, prompting the user to select a new date/time or deferring it to the next day by default (part of Feature 4.6).
    *   The dashboard should refresh to reflect status changes without requiring a full page reload.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User has no tasks scheduled for the current day.
    *   User has a very large number of tasks for one day (consider scrolling/pagination).
    *   Marking a task complete fails due to a backend error.
    *   Timezone issues affecting "today's" tasks.
    *   User tries to interact with tasks from an inactive or completed goal.

### 4.4 Progress Tracker

*   **Description:** Provides users with a visual overview of their progress towards completing their goal and milestones.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to see my overall completion percentage for my goal to understand how far along I am.
    *   As a user, I want to see my progress within the current week or milestone.
    *   As a user, I want to know if I'm on track, ahead, or behind schedule.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   A dedicated section or element (e.g., progress bar, percentage display) must show the overall completion rate of the goal (Total tasks completed / Total tasks in plan).
    *   Progress within the current milestone or week should be visually indicated.
    *   The system must calculate and display whether the user is on track based on the original timeline and current completion rate/missed tasks.
    *   The progress view must update whenever a task status changes.
    *   Milestone checkpoints from the AI plan should be clearly visible, indicating whether previous milestones were completed on time.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Plan has 0 tasks (edge case from AI).
    *   User completes tasks far ahead of schedule (progress > 100% for the current period).
    *   Progress calculation is inaccurate due to complex rescheduling.

### 4.5 Multiple Goals Management

*   **Description:** Allows users (likely Premium tier) to create, view, and manage more than one goal simultaneously.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user with multiple goals, I want to see a list of all my active goals.
    *   As a user with multiple goals, I want to easily switch between viewing the dashboard/progress for different goals.
    *   As a user, I want tasks from different goals to be clearly distinguishable or managed separately.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   There must be an interface element (e.g., a list or dropdown) to view all goals associated with the user account.
    *   Users must be able to select a goal to make it the "active" goal, whose dashboard and progress are displayed.
    *   (For future iteration) A combined dashboard view showing tasks from multiple goals scheduled for today could be an option, clearly labeling which goal each task belongs to.
    *   Progress tracking must be maintained independently for each goal.
    *   Adding a new goal should follow the same Goal Input process (Feature 4.1).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User creates an excessive number of goals, impacting performance.
    *   Switching between goals is slow or buggy.
    *   Tasks from different goals are accidentally mixed up in the database or UI.
    *   Free tier users attempt to create a second goal (should be blocked or prompted to upgrade).

### 4.6 Reschedule & Adaptation

*   **Description:** The intelligent system that automatically adjusts the plan based on user interaction (completing early, missing tasks) or manual rescheduling.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want the app to automatically adjust my plan if I fall behind so I don't have to manually figure out how to catch up.
    *   As a user, if I complete tasks faster than expected, I want the plan to potentially accelerate or give me buffer time.
    *   As a user, I want to manually reschedule a specific task to a different day.
    *   As a user, I want to be notified if missing tasks puts my goal deadline at risk.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   When a task's scheduled date passes without it being marked "Complete," the system must mark it as "Overdue."
    *   The system must have logic to redistribute overdue tasks and subsequent tasks based on the user's "Time per Day" commitment and the remaining duration.
    *   Adaptation logic should attempt to keep the original end date if possible by increasing daily workload slightly, but warn the user if the required daily time exceeds a reasonable limit or the goal becomes impossible within the timeframe.
    *   If tasks are completed ahead of schedule, the system should either bring future tasks forward (if dependencies allow) or indicate the user is ahead/has buffer. (Start with handling missed tasks first).
    *   Users must be able to manually select one or more tasks and reschedule them to a specific future date.
    *   Rescheduling manually should trigger the adaptation logic for subsequent tasks if necessary.
    *   The system must send push notifications or in-app alerts when significant plan adjustments occur due to falling behind or when the deadline is at risk.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User misses a very large number of tasks (e.g., doesn't use the app for weeks). The adaptation might need a cap or different strategy (e.g., suggest extending the deadline).
    *   Adaptation results in an unrealistically heavy workload for future days.
    *   Manual rescheduling conflicts with automated adaptation logic.
    *   Dependencies between tasks are not explicitly modeled, leading to illogical task reordering (AI generates sequential tasks, assume this implies order).
    *   User reschedules a task to a date *before* the current date.

### 4.7 Calendar Integration (Optional for MVP, valuable for V2)

*   **Description:** Allows users to sync their Todo AI tasks with external calendar services like Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user who lives by my calendar, I want my daily tasks from Todo AI to appear as events in Google Calendar so I can see them alongside meetings.
    *   As a user, I want updates to my plan in Todo AI (rescheduling, completion) to sync with my external calendar.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Users can authenticate their Google Calendar or Apple Calendar account via OAuth.
    *   Users can select which goals' tasks to export to the calendar.
    *   Daily tasks from the selected goals are exported as calendar events on their scheduled date.
    *   Events should include the task description and ideally a link back to the task in the Todo AI app.
    *   *(For V2)* Changes to tasks in Todo AI (reschedule, completion) should update the corresponding calendar event.
    *   Users can disconnect the calendar integration.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Calendar service API limits are reached.
    *   Authentication fails or tokens expire.
    *   Synchronization errors occur (e.g., task updated in app but not calendar).
    *   Handling recurring tasks (Todo AI currently generates unique daily tasks, but AI might create patterns).
    *   User deletes events directly in the calendar (should ideally not affect the Todo AI plan).

### 4.8 Mid-Goal Revision

*   **Description:** Allows users to modify the parameters of an active goal, triggering a plan regeneration based on current progress.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, if I realize I can commit more or less time per day, I want to update my goal accordingly and get a new plan.
    *   As a user, if my progress is significantly faster or slower than expected, I want to extend or shorten the timeframe and have the plan adjust.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   An option to "Edit" or "Revise Goal" must be available for active goals.
    *   The interface should allow editing of Timeframe and Time per Day. (Initially limit editable fields to these).
    *   Upon saving changes, the system must call the AI Goal Decomposer, passing the *new* parameters *and* the user's current progress/completed tasks.
    *   The AI (or adaptation logic) must generate a revised plan for the *remaining* duration, incorporating the completed tasks and updating future tasks based on the new constraints.
    *   The user must see a preview of the revised plan before confirming the change.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User attempts to change the core Goal Name or Topic significantly (e.g., "Learn Python" to "Get Fit"). This should be disallowed or create a new goal.
    *   AI struggles to create a coherent plan based on partial completion and drastically changed parameters.
    *   User sets impossible new parameters (e.g., reduce timeframe significantly despite being behind). System should warn.

### 4.9 Goal Completion & Summary

*   **Description:** Provides a concluding experience when a goal is completed, summarizing the journey.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to feel a sense of accomplishment when I complete all tasks for a goal.
    *   As a user, I want to see a summary of my journey and achievements for a completed goal.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system must detect when all tasks associated with a specific goal have been marked "Complete."
    *   Upon completion, a celebratory screen or notification should be displayed.
    *   A "Goal Summary" view should be accessible for completed goals, showing:
        *   Goal Name and Original Parameters.
        *   Actual Start and End Dates.
        *   Overall Completion Percentage.
        *   Number of tasks completed vs. total tasks.
        *   (Optional: Visual timeline of progress).
    *   Completed goals should be moved to a separate "Completed" section and no longer appear in the main active goal view.
    *   Users should have the option to archive or permanently delete completed goals.
    *   *(Future)* Option to generate a shareable summary or certificate.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User marks the *final* task complete offline, sync fails.
    *   System doesn't correctly detect all tasks completed (e.g., missed tasks were implicitly 'completed' by plan adaptation).
    *   User deletes tasks instead of completing them, breaking the "all tasks complete" logic.

## 5. Technical Requirements
