## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of the Todo AI application is to bridge the gap between a user's high-level ambitions and their daily execution by automatically generating personalized, actionable roadmaps. The application leverages artificial intelligence (specifically large language models like GPT) to break down complex goals with defined timeframes into structured, manageable daily and weekly tasks. It serves as an intelligent personal planner that adapts to the user's progress.

### 2.2 Goals

*   To enable users to easily translate ambitious goals into practical, step-by-step plans.
*   To provide a dynamic roadmap that automatically adjusts based on user progress (completion, delays).
*   To increase user success rates in achieving their defined goals by providing structure and accountability.
*   To offer a user-friendly interface for managing goals and tracking progress.

### 2.3 Target Users

*   Individuals pursuing personal development, skill acquisition (e.g., learning a new language, programming), or health/fitness objectives.
*   Students preparing for exams or managing study schedules.
*   Entrepreneurs and project managers building MVPs or managing small projects.
*   Anyone who struggles with planning and breaking down large tasks.

## 5. Dependencies and Constraints

This section lists external factors and limitations affecting the project.

### 5.1 Dependencies

*   **AI Service Provider:** Reliance on a third-party AI model API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4). This is critical for the core functionality.
*   **Calendar API Providers:** Integration relies on external calendar APIs (Google Calendar API, Apple Calendar API).
*   **Notification Service Provider:** Need for services to send emails and push notifications.
*   **Cloud Hosting Provider:** Infrastructure relies on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).

### 5.2 Constraints

*   **AI API Costs:** Usage of the AI API will incur costs, which need to be managed, especially for free tier users or during plan generation.
*   **AI API Rate Limits:** External AI services have rate limits that could affect performance under high load or during batch processing (like plan adaptation).
*   **AI Plan Quality:** The quality and relevance of the generated plans are dependent on the AI model's capabilities and the prompt engineering; there is a risk of receiving suboptimal or incorrect plans.
*   **Calendar Integration Scope:** Initial implementation might be limited to one-way sync (App -> Calendar). Two-way sync adds complexity.
*   **Data Privacy Regulations:** Must comply with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, etc., impacting how user data (including goal details) is stored and processed.
*   **Project Timeline:** The project must be completed within a defined timeframe (not specified in the prompt, but a typical constraint).
