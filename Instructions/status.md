# Project Status Report: Todo AI - AI Goal Planner

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 9, 2025
**Prepared By:** [Your Name/Team Name]

## 1. Project Summary

The Todo AI project aims to develop an AI-powered application that transforms high-level user goals (e.g., "Learn Python in 90 days") into structured, actionable daily/weekly task roadmaps. Leveraging AI (specifically GPT for decomposition), the app creates a personalized plan stored in a user's planner. A key feature is the intelligent adaptation of the plan based on user progress (tasks completed, missed, or rescheduled), acting as a dynamic bridge between user ambition and consistent execution.

**Goal:** To provide users with a personalized, automatically adapting daily/weekly plan derived from their high-level goals and timeframes.
**Status:** [e.g., Planning Phase Complete, Development Underway, Alpha Testing]
**Reporting Period:** [e.g., Week of June 3rd - June 7th]
