# Technology Stack Recommendation: AI-Powered Goal Planner

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 9, 2025

## Technology Summary

This document outlines a recommended technology stack for the AI-Powered Goal Planner application. The architecture follows a standard three-tier pattern: a frontend user interface, a backend API server, and a database. The backend serves as the central hub, handling user requests, interacting with the database, managing application logic, and critically, integrating with the external AI service for goal decomposition. The focus is on modern, scalable, and maintainable technologies suitable for a dynamic web application with external dependencies.

## Frontend Recommendations

*   **Framework:** **React (with TypeScript)**
    *   **Justification:** React is a leading JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture, strong community support, and large ecosystem. Using TypeScript enhances code maintainability and reduces runtime errors by providing static typing.
*   **State Management:** **React Query (or SWR) for Server State + Zustand (or React Context) for UI State**
    *   **Justification:** React Query/SWR excel at managing asynchronous data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend API (goals, tasks, progress). This significantly simplifies data handling logic. For less complex, local UI state (e.g., modal open/closed, form values), Zustand offers a simple, lightweight alternative to Redux, or React Context can be used for basic state sharing.
*   **UI Libraries:** **Chakra UI or Material UI (MUI)**
    *   **Justification:** These libraries provide pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI components (buttons, forms, dashboards, calendar pickers, etc.) based on modern design systems. This accelerates frontend development and ensures a consistent look and feel. Tailwind CSS is an alternative for a utility-first approach if more granular styling control is desired.

## Backend Recommendations

*   **Language:** **Node.js (with TypeScript)**
    *   **Justification:** Node.js is well-suited for I/O-bound tasks like making HTTP requests to external APIs (like OpenAI's GPT) due to its asynchronous, non-blocking nature. Using TypeScript adds type safety and improves code quality and maintainability, especially as the application grows.
*   **Framework:** **NestJS or Express.js**
    *   **Justification:**
        *   *NestJS:* A progressive Node.js framework that provides a structured, opinionated architecture (based on Angular concepts like modules, controllers, providers). It's excellent for building scalable and maintainable applications, offering features like dependency injection out-of-the-box. Recommended for larger, more complex applications.
        *   *Express.js:* A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework. Good for rapid prototyping or smaller applications where less structure is preferred.
        *   *Decision:* NestJS is generally recommended for its structure and scalability benefits, which will be valuable as the app adds features like multiple goals, complex adaptation logic, and monetization.
*   **API Design:** **RESTful API**
    *   **Justification:** REST is a widely adopted and well-understood architectural style for building web APIs. It provides a clear, stateless way for the frontend to interact with backend resources (Users, Goals, Tasks, Progress). While GraphQL is an alternative that could reduce over/under-fetching, REST is simpler to implement initially and sufficient for the described features.

## Database Selection

*   **Database Type:** **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)**
    *   **Justification:** A relational database is the ideal choice for storing the structured and interconnected data required by this application: Users, their Goals, the generated Milestones, Weeks, Days, and Tasks, along with their status and progress. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source, and feature-rich relational database known for its reliability, extensibility, and strong support for complex queries and data integrity.
*   **Schema Approach:** **Normalized Relational Schema**
    *   **Justification:** A standard normalized schema with tables for `Users`, `Goals`, `Milestones`, `Weeks`, `Days`, and `Tasks` (and linking tables as needed) will ensure data consistency, minimize redundancy, and facilitate complex queries required for progress tracking, reporting, and plan adaptation logic. The JSON output from the AI will be parsed by the backend and stored in this structured format across the relevant tables (`Milestones`, `Weeks`, `Days`, `Tasks`). Additional tables for `ProgressLogs`, `Notifications`, etc., will be needed.

## DevOps Considerations

*   **Containerization:** **Docker**
    *   **Justification:** Containerizing the frontend (serving static files) and backend services ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments. It simplifies deployment and scaling.
*   **Deployment:** **AWS or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
    *   **Justification:** Leading cloud providers offering a wide range of scalable services.
        *   *Compute:* **AWS ECS/EKS (containers) or Lambda (serverless API) / GCP GKE (containers) or Cloud Functions (serverless API)** - Choose based on preference for managed container orchestration vs. serverless functions.
        *   *Database:* **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) / GCP Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)** - Managed database services reduce operational overhead.
        *   *Static Assets (Frontend/User Uploads):* **AWS S3 / GCP Cloud Storage**
    *   *Alternative (Simpler Start):* **Heroku or Render** provide simpler PaaS options for getting started, abstracting much of the underlying infrastructure, but may be less flexible or cost-effective at scale compared to AWS/GCP.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** **Terraform**
    *   **Justification:** Managing infrastructure using code allows for repeatable, versioned, and automated provisioning and management of cloud resources across environments. Terraform supports multiple cloud providers.
*   **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions or GitLab CI**
    *   **Justification:** Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines directly integrated with source control repositories simplifies the release process, ensures code quality, and speeds up iteration cycles.

## External Services

*   **AI Goal Decomposition:** **OpenAI API (GPT-4 or similar)**
    *   **Justification:** The core AI functionality relies on a large language model like OpenAI's GPT series to interpret user goals and generate structured roadmaps. The backend will integrate with this API.
*   **Calendar Integration:** **Google Calendar API, Apple Calendar API (via CalDAV or specific libraries)**
    *   **Justification:** To allow users to export tasks to their personal calendars. Requires implementing OAuth flows and interacting with the respective calendar service APIs.
*   **Notifications:** **SendGrid or Mailgun (for Email), Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal (for Push Notifications)**
    *   **Justification:** Reliable third-party services for sending email notifications (e.g., reminders, progress reports) and potentially push notifications to mobile users (if a mobile app is developed later).
*   **Payment Processing (Monetization):** **Stripe or PayPal**
    *   **Justification:** Industry-standard platforms for handling subscriptions and payments for premium tiers or template sales.
*   **Optional: Analytics:** **Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or PostHog**
    *   **Justification:** To track user behavior, feature usage, and understand user journeys within the application for product improvement.
